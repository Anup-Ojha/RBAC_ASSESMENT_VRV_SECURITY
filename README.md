# RBAC UI - Role-Based Access Control Dashboard

## ✨ Overview

This project is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI** designed to help manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently. The dashboard provides a secure, user-friendly interface where administrators can assign roles, modify permissions, and manage user access seamlessly. Built with [Insert Frontend Framework Name Here], it features flexibility in handling RBAC operations.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Management**:  
  ➕ Add, ✏️ Edit, and ❌ Delete users.  
  🔑 Assign roles to users and manage their status (Active/Inactive).

- **Role Management**:  
  📝 Create, ✏️ Edit, and ❌ Delete roles.  
  🛠️ Assign permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) to roles.

- **Dynamic Permissions**:  
  🔄 Assign, modify, and view permissions for each role dynamically.

- **Responsive Design**:  
  📱 The UI adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.

- **Security Practices**:  
  🔒 Implements input validation and error handling for robust security.

- **Additional Features (Bonus)**:  
  🔍 Sorting, filtering, and search functionality for easy user and role management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: [Insert Framework Name, e.g., React, Angular, Vue]  
- **UI Design**: [Insert any design libraries used, e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI]  
- **State Management**: [Insert State Management Tool, if applicable, e.g., Redux, NgRx]  
- **API Simulation**: Mock API calls to simulate CRUD operations for users and roles.  
- **Other Libraries/Tools**: [List any other libraries used, such as Axios for API calls, etc.]

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing dependencies

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anup-Ojha/rbac-ui.git
cd rbac-ui
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm or Yarn:

With **npm**:

```bash
npm install
```

With **Yarn**:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Run the Development Server

To start the development server:

## 📡 API Simulation

This project includes mocked API endpoints for CRUD operations:

- `GET /api/users` – Fetches the list of users.
- `POST /api/users` – Creates a new user.
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` – Updates a specific user.
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}` – Deletes a user.

Similar endpoints exist for managing roles and permissions.

## 🔐 Security Practices

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing.
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages are provided when failures occur.
- **Data Protection**: Mock data is used, and user permissions are validated effectively.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the tests using:

With **npm**:

```bash
npm test
```

With **Yarn**:

```bash
yarn test
```

## 🚀 Deployment

To deploy the application:

Build the production version of the app:

With **npm**:

```bash
npm run build
```

With **Yarn**:

```bash
yarn build
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Database Setup and Admin Details**

Install MongoDB and open MongoDB Compass.
Open MongoDB Compass, copy the connection string, and paste it into the `.env` file.
The `anup_rbac` collection will auto-create on app start.
Run npm run dev in the terminal to start the app.
Register the first admin with vrv@gmail.com and a chosen password.
Create regular users as needed and log in to test features.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then, deploy the `build/` folder to your preferred hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or a custom server).
